Casey Levitt
Trisha Karani

Casey implemented fatalError(), isSpace(), isDigit(), skipws(), stackPush(), evalOp(), and
	wrote the system tests.

Trisha implemented tokenType(), consumeInt(), and consumeOp().

We implemented stackPop() and eval() together.






Tests to Include: 
- result in neg number 
- neg number in string (will be read as a negative sign)
- values not separated by whitespace
- just one long whitespace 
- more operators than operands 
	- operations on stack with one integer
	- operations on empty stack 
	- operations on stack that has been filled and then cleared? (don't think this is possible...)
- stack non-empty when complete
- division by zero 
- count for stack is -1?
- a lot of push and then a lot of operators
